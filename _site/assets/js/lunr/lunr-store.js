        "excerpt":"    Miss Barry had always been a big supporter of my artworks and it was a particular pleasure creating these for her and her family. It was also a tremendous help for me at the time so I am forever grateful for her help!   Mediums used were the typical oil paints on canvas, utilizing an easel for the first time for both! The faces of the parents posed a particular challenge at the time which I think I overcame, and am really happy with the look I managed to capture in her sister's eyes.

        "excerpt":"    2019 was certainly a restart to my commissons career with a dear friend ordering these as a gift for her parents. Despite missing the Christmas deadline, I think we were both very happy with the result. Oil paints on canvas.   I usually rely on the eyes within a painting to portray a facial expression and feeling. While you can't see them directly in either these, I am really happy that I managed to capture the look of care and love given by both parents.   Thank you M for the countless of delicious meals and funny stories!                                                                                        ","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"    This poster started off as a concept in the early days of uni. My time in Groningen (a.k.a. The Gronx) has been so memorable due to the people I met and was lucky enough to befriend. As most of us were far away from home, we naturally formed a very tight and supporting family. To celebrate this, and to learn a bit about Adobe Illustrator, I started working on this piece in my off time.   As the years dragged on and I met more people that I wanted to add to this poster it became apparent that it soon had to be finished. This is dedicated to everyone who made my time in Groningen so memorable, whether you may still be here with us or not.                                                  ","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"Working with my father is always an interesting but rewarding experience. While the typical theme (dragonflies) is not my main interest, it is always nice to draw something new and be part of a unique project   This time we teamed up for a field guide published by the Auckland University Press. My father approached me to help him out with the pencil illustrations, with the coloured ones being handled by someone with a little more expertise.   I am particularly pleased with the first drawing in the gallery, the one illustrating the abdomen muscles connecting to the wings. In the end the book came out great, and even won one of the 2020 Whitley Awards for Best Illustrated Field Guide!
