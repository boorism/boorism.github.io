It was also a tremendous help for me at the time so I am forever grateful for her help!   Mediums used were the typical oil paints on canvas, utilizing an easel for the first time for both! The faces of the parents posed a particular challenge at the time which I think I overcame, and am really happy with the look I managed to capture in her sister’s eyes.

My time in Groningen (aka The Gronx) has been so memorable due to the people I met and was lucky enough to befriend. As most of us were far away from home, we naturally formed a very tight and supporting family. To celebrate this, and to learn a bit about Adobe Illustrator, I started working on this piece in my off time.
