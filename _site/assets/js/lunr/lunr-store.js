It seemed like I was starting to find a niche of painting people's parents. While the painting contained everything I liked and was used to drawing, it did take me sometime to motivate myself to finish this work. My last year in Gron was taxing in a lot of ways, and sadly this at times reflected into my work.   Nevertheless, a year or so later this came out of the factory. I hope he's happy with it and his parents even more so. Donny started off as being one of my students, quickly moving up the ranks in friendship status and ending up being a supporting beam for the last stretches of uni. What I wouldn't give to have one last 4pm skate sesh at the carpark, watching him break a sweat over those heelflips. Keep pushing forward mate and I will see you for another adventure soon!

It was also a tremendous help for me at the time so I am forever grateful for her help!   Mediums used were the typical oil paints on canvas, utilizing an easel for the first time for both! The faces of the parents posed a particular challenge at the time which I think I overcame, and am really happy with the look I managed to capture in her sister's eyes.   ","categories": [],

Despite missing the Christmas deadline, I think we were both very happy with the result. Oil paints on canvas.   I usually rely on the eyes within a painting to portray a facial expression and feeling. While you can't see them directly in either these, I am really happy that I managed to capture the look of care and love given by both parents.

The Gronx) has been so memorable due to the people I met and was lucky enough to befriend. As most of us were far away from home, we naturally formed a very tight and supporting family. To celebrate this, and to learn a bit about Adobe Illustrator, I started working on this piece in my off time.   As the years dragged on and I met more people that I wanted to add to this poster it became apparent that it soon had to be finished. This is dedicated to everyone who made my time in Groningen so memorable, whether you may still be here with us or not.   ","categories": [],

While the typical theme (dragonflies) is not my main interest, it is always nice to draw something new and be part of a unique project   This time we teamed up for a field guide published by the Auckland University Press. My father approached me to help him out with the pencil illustrations, with the coloured ones being handled by someone with a little more expertise.   I am particularly pleased with the first drawing in the gallery, the one illustrating the abdomen muscles connecting to the wings. In the end the book came out great, and even won one of the 2020 Whitley Awards for Best Illustrated Field Guide!      ","categories": [],

The original intent was to try and sell some prints (offer still available..) after the success of my Mr. White endeavours, but somehow things didn't kick off as planned.   Nevertheless, I was always really happy with this painting. I am fond of the \"toxic\" green and the movement which I think is captured in the background. I usually focus primarily on the subject of the painting, leaving the background secondary and often a random color, which definitely isn't the case here.   This work now hangs at a fellow geek's house, hopefully reminding him of the good times and the even better times ahead.  ","categories": [],

Luckily, I had also met one of my closest-to-date friends and it didn't take long for us to plan his portrait. Oil paints on canvas.   I have so many fond memories and probably too much nostalgia of our times in C39 and couldn't be happier with how the painting turned out. I like to think I was able to capture his unique style (that I gladly copied and improved on..) and the kindness this boy had in him.   If you're ever in the mood for some good music, I'd highly recommend his podcast series about house and disco. Your boy even gets a special shout-out on Episode 7 just before the 4min mark.

At the time I was working as a laboratory assistant, saving everything I could for my move to the Netherlands. Naturally this meant accepting commissions left and right for family and friends.   These are some of the commissions at the time, while the painting of Charlie (the dog) was a gift for the Franks family, who had accepted me as their second son temporarily due to my parents having to move cities for a bit.   Charlie is one of the few non-human works that I have done and it probably came out as one of the best. The least I could do for the Franks for their huge favour and years of friendship, support and rides to the beach.   ","categories": [],

I had been commissioned at the time by my highschool chemistry teacher to paint him whatever I wanted. Being obsessed with the events of Breaking Bad I decided it was a fitting subject, and tried to include my limited chemistry knowledge by immitating the first entry of the periodic table. The 'H' here stands for both Hisenberg and Hydrogen, with the numbers in the corners relating to the atomic numbers and weights, something I'm often asked to explain.   The success from this painting was a bit more than anticipated. My teacher was of course very happy with it, but I also had the idea of offering prints online. A day or so after posting it, it blew up and I found myself running back and forth to the print shop for weeks. Funds for uni were always welcome, and it motivated me to stick to art as a secondary hussle.  ","categories": [],

Mostly oil on canvas or pencil; (2012-2014)       While the tendency towards art has always been with me, the particular art style of realism and focusing on painting people really kicked off in highschool.   All these paintings were done for my art class, for which we had to develop different panels of evolving work on some topic. The most successful work is of the girl with the blue smoke, and I believe it still hangs somewhere in the halls at school.  ","categories": [],
