<p align = "justify">Working with my father is always an interesting but rewarding experience. While the typical theme (dragonflies) is not my main interest, it is always nice to draw something new and be part of a unique project</p>

<p align = "justify">This time we teamed up for a field guide published by the <a href = "https://aucklanduniversitypress.co.nz/dragonflies-and-damselflies-of-new-zealand/">Auckland University Press</a>. My father approached me to help him out with the pencil illustrations, with the coloured ones being handled by someone with a little more expertise.</p>

<p align = "justify">I am particularly pleased with the first drawing in the gallery, the one illustrating the abdomen muscles connecting to the wings. In the end the book came out great, and even won one of the <a href = "https://www.rzsnsw.org.au/grants-awards/previous-winners/2020-winners">2020 Whitley Awards for Best Illustrated Field Guide</a>!
