<p align = "justify">A little piece which was mostly done out of self interest in the midst of the Game of Thrones hype. The original intent was to try and sell some prints (offer still available..) after the success of my Mr. White endevaours, but somehow things didn't kick off as planned.</p>

<p align = "justify">Nevertheless, I was always really happy with this painting. I really enjoy the "toxic" green and the movement which I think is captured in the background. I usually focus primarily on the subject of the painting, leaving the background secondary and often a random color, which definitely isn't the case here.</p>

<p align = "justify">This work now hangs at a fellow geek's house, hopefully reminding him of the good times and the even better times ahead.</p>
