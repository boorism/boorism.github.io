<p align = "justify">Overwhelmed by the novelty of my first year of uni, I had found it difficult to find the time or motivation to start a new painting. Luckily, I had also met one of my closest-to-date friends and it didn't take long for us to plan his portrait. Oil paints on canvas.</p>

<p align = "justify">I have so many fond memories and probably too much nostalgia of our times in C39 and couldn't be happier with how the painting turned out. I like to think I was able to capture his unique style (that I gladly copied and improved on..) and the kindness this boy had in him.</p>

<p align = "justify">If you're ever in the mood for some good music, I'd highly recommend his podcast series about house and disco. Your boy even gets a special shout-out on Episode 7 just before the 4min mark. Keep it up Bob!</p>
