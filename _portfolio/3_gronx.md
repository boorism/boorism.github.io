This poster started off as a concept in the early days of uni. My time in Groningen (aka The Gronx) has been so memorable due to the people I met and was lucky enough to befriend. As most of us were far away from home, we naturally formed a very tight and supporting family. To celebrate this, and to learn a bit about Adobe Illustrator, I started working on this piece in my off time. 

As the years dragged on and I met more people that I wanted to add to this trial
