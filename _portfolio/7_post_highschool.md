<p align = "justify">There was a bit of a buffer period between the end of my highschool days and the university era. At the time I was working as a laboratory assistant, saving everything I could for my move to the Netherlands. Naturally this meant accepting commissions left and right for family and friends.</p>

<p align = "justify">These are some of the commissions at the time, while the painting of Charlie (the dog) was a gift for the Franks family, who had accepted me as their second son temporarily due to my parents having to move cities for a bit.</p>

<p align = "justify">Charlie is one of the few non-human works that I have done and it probably came out as one of the best. The least I could do for the Franks for their huge favour and years of friendship and support</p>
