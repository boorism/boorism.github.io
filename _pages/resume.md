# Projects 
---------

A list of the major projects I have been a part of. For more detail, as well as more personal and smaller work, check out the [Posts](/posts-by-year/) page

## Master's Projects

2020 - 2021
<br>
: **Master's Thesis:** <br/><br/> [*Machine Learning Classification of the Coronary Artery Disease and Clustering of
Unstructured Free-Form Medical Complaints*](/assets/documents/Master_Thesis_Boris_Final.pdf)

  * Grade: X
  * Supervised by: [Dr. ir. Peter van Ooijen](https://www.rug.nl/staff/p.m.a.van.ooijen/) & [Dr. Fokie Cnossen](https://www.rug.nl/staff/f.cnossen/)
  * Part of the Nationwide Dutch [CONCRETE](https://concrete-project.nl) Project
  * Investigated the predictive capability of self-reported patient quality-of-life data with regards to the Coronary Artery Disease severity levels. The classification pipeline demonstrated that predictions can be useful and could improve the efficiency of the Dutch healthcare system. Also proposed a [BERT-based unsupervised clustering method]() which can discover groups of similar medical textal complaints, with the method displaying noticeable adavantages over standard topic modeling approaches.

<br>

: **Master's Internship:** <br/><br/> [*3D visualisations of the flow, spread and interaction of QAnon topics and locations: A Social Network Analysis*](/assets/documents/Report_on_Visualisations_final.pdf)

  * Grade: 9
  * Student internship at [TextGain](https://www.textgain.com): a Belgian text-analytics company focusing on AI and NLP application
  * Researched and proposed a general pipeline for performing and visualising social network analysis (SNA) on Twitter data with regards to the QAnon movement. Extracted NLP-based attributes from the tweets and used them to cluster groups of inlfluential users. Further captured the discourse flow and general location outreach of the conspiracy movement.

---------
<br>

: **Master's Research Project:** <br/><br/> [*Topic and Emotion Development among Dutch COVID-19 Twitter Communities in the early Pandemic*](/assets/documents/peoples_paper.pdf)

  * Grade: 9
  * Supervised by: [Dr. Jennifer Spenader](https://www.rug.nl/staff/j.k.spenader/?lang=en) & [Tommaso Caselli (PhD)](https://www.rug.nl/staff/t.caselli/)
  * Paper published in the [COLING PEOPLES 2020 Workshop](https://peopleswksh.github.io)
  * Carried out an extensive analysis of over 2.4 million Dutch tweets related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Investigated the public's response to the event using short-text topic modeling, emotional lexicon look-up analysis and general exploratory data methods. One of my first bigger and independent projects so I considered the symposium acceptance as a great personal achievement!

## Bachelor's Projects

2018-2019
<br>
: **Bachelor's Thesis:** <br/><br/> [*Resolving the Pronoun Problem: Investigating the Inlfuence of Linguistic and Visual Contexts on Object Pronoun Processing*](/assets/documents/Bach_Thesis.pdf)

  * Grade: 8.5
  * Supervised by: [Dr. Jelmer Borst](https://www.rug.nl/staff/j.p.borst/) & [Dr. Jacolien van Rij-Tange](https://www.rug.nl/staff/j.c.van.rij/)
  * Eye-tracking study investigating how a visual scene affects pupil size in resolving different pronoun types.

# Experience
---------
My experiences in different aspects of life so far. I strongly believe in diving into as many different things as possible, as each new challenge and step out of a comfort zone can be so rewarding and vocational. 

## Work

2020
<br>
: **Managing Teaching Assistant: General Linguistics** 

  * University of Groningen
  * A "higher-up" student teaching job which had me working much closer with the professor ([Dr. Jennifer Spenader](https://www.rug.nl/staff/j.k.spenader/?lang=en)) of the course. Worked together on creating homeworks, exams and managing the other TAs and students. A particular challenge of this job was having to quickly adjust midway into the course to online teaching due to the sudden pandemic.

---------

2017-2019
<br>
: **Teaching Assistant**

  * University of Groningen
  * Courses: General Linguistics, Basic Scientific Skills, Introduction to AI, Cognitive Psychology
  * Assisting professors across different subjects with grading of assignments, giving tutorials to students throughout the semesters and general course structure responsibilities. I particularly enjoyed these employments as it not only gave a feeling of fulfillment, but also solidified my own knowledge in the fields and increased my own confidence as a person, public speaker and leader.

: **Student Mentor**

  * University of Groningen
  * Played a key role in accomodating students with their integration into the univesity system and life. Being a first point of contact for my mentor group, carrying out meetings and organizing social activities. Being a mentor was a highlight in my university career, like the TA roles it was rewarding but also helped me make some life-long friends! 

---------
2015
<br>
: **Laboratory Assistant**

  * [Canterbury Health Labs](https://www.chl.co.nz)
  * My first job out of highschool. Spend some time working in the labs as an intern and used the money to save up for my university move to the Netherlands. Got to see the inner workings of the healthcare system. Worked across the different departments and performed different laboratory tests with real patient samples! An early motivator to attempt and stay within the medical field.
