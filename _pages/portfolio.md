  Art Portfolio
</h1>

<p align = "justify">The visual and fine arts are a big part of my personality and something that has been with me from an early age. It has taught me patience, creativity and attention to detail, things I believe I implicitly bring into my technical work and research.</p>

<p align = "justify">Showcasing my paintings and artworks was a big motivating factor for creating this website and I hope you enjoy them as much as I enjoyed making them.</p>

<p align = "justify">A big shout-out to the people who inspired and supported these and countless of other unpublished drawings. You guys know who you are.</p>
