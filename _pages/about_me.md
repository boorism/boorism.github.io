Hi again!

  <img class="about" src="/assets/images/author/me3.jpg">
  I'm Boris, a Bulgarian boy who spent his teenage years in New Zealand and completed his university studies in the Netherlands. 
  <br>
  <br>
  I'm currently back in Christchuch, looking for my next adventure. While unsure of where or what that may be, I do know that I'm very passionate and curious about AI and data science related research.

Interests
</h2>

Overall I have a pretty curious nature, but for times-sake I try and keep my non-technical interests and hobbies to the following main subjects.

  A big passion of mine is classical hip-hop culture and the numerous albums that have come with it.
