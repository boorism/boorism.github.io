  I'm Boris, a Bulgarian boy who spent his teenage years in New Zealand and completed his university studies in the Netherlands.

  <br>
  I'm currently looking for my next adventure and while unsure of where or what that may be, I do know that I'm very passionate and curious about AI and data science.
