Hi again!

  <img class="about" src="/assets/images/author/me3.jpg">
  I'm Boris, a Bulgarian boy who spent his teenage years in New Zealand and completed his university studies in the Netherlands. 
  <br>
  <br>
  I'm currently back in Christchuch, looking for my next adventure. While unsure of where or what that may be, I do know that I'm very passionate and curious about AI and data science related research.

  A big passion of mine is music, and in particular classical hip-hop culture with the countless albums that accompany it. From DOOM to Wu, Lord Finesse to Big L, the list is long and would need a site of its own.
    <br>
    <br>
    Living in the Netherlands has also opened my eyes to electronic music, and in particular the dub/minimal/house genre. It's great for studying and also meeting some awesome people.
